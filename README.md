## Milestones of the project.

### Day 1

**Milestone 1 - project setup**

Select the API you are going to use. Build files structure for your React app. Prepare routes and navigation in your app.

**Milestone 2 - index page with filters**

Make sure that a user can display a list of items and filter them. Data should come from the backend API.

### Day 2

**Milestone 1 - single item page**

Make sure that a user can display a details page for each item. Data should come from the backend API.

**Milestone 2 - styling & testing**

If you need some extra time for adding tests or making your app more beautiful. Now it's the time for this! Also, you can fix any minor bugs that you could have found in your app.

### Day 3

**Milestone 1 - connect to API and receive data**

Work on nice-to have features(s)

**Milestone 2 - deploy & video**

Check if the deployed version of the app is working perfectly. Record your video. You are ready for a code review!
